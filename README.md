# Ride Sharing Data Processing System: Concurrency and Exception Handling in Java and Go

## Introduction

This report explains the concurrency and exception handling techniques used in the Ride Sharing Data Processing System, implemented in both Java and Go. It also compares the concurrency models of the two languages. The report is written in plain English, following APA 7 guidelines.

## Concurrency in Java

Java uses threads and synchronization to manage concurrency. In this project, a shared task queue is accessed by multiple worker threads. To prevent race conditions (where two threads try to change the queue at the same time), the queue uses the `synchronized` keyword. This ensures that only one thread can add or remove a task at a time. Workers are managed using an `ExecutorService`, which makes it easy to start and stop multiple threads. Each worker takes a task, processes it, and writes the result to a shared list. The shared list is also accessed in a thread-safe way using `synchronized` blocks.

## Exception Handling in Java

Java uses try-catch blocks to handle exceptions. In this system, workers use try-catch to handle `InterruptedException` (if a thread is interrupted while waiting or sleeping) and other general exceptions. If an error happens, it is logged using Java’s logging system. This helps keep the program running smoothly and makes it easy to find and fix problems.

## Concurrency in Go

Go uses goroutines and channels for concurrency. Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by Go. Channels are used to safely pass tasks and results between goroutines. In this project, a channel acts as the shared task queue. Multiple worker goroutines read from the channel, process tasks, and send results to another channel. The Go runtime ensures that only one goroutine can read or write to a channel at a time, so there is no need for explicit locks or synchronization.

## Exception Handling in Go

Go does not have exceptions like Java. Instead, functions return error values. In this system, errors (such as file I/O problems) are checked after each operation. If an error occurs, it is logged using Go’s `log` package. The `defer` statement is used to make sure resources are cleaned up properly, even if an error happens.

## Comparison of Concurrency Models

Java and Go handle concurrency differently. Java uses threads and explicit synchronization (like locks and `synchronized` blocks) to protect shared resources. This gives the programmer more control but also requires careful management to avoid problems like deadlocks. Go uses goroutines and channels, which make it easier to write concurrent code without worrying about locks. Channels provide a safe way to communicate between goroutines, reducing the risk of race conditions.

## Conclusion

Both Java and Go provide strong tools for concurrency and error handling. Java’s model is based on threads and locks, while Go uses goroutines and channels. Each approach has its strengths: Java offers fine-grained control, while Go makes concurrency simpler and less error-prone. In both implementations, proper error handling and logging ensure that the system is robust and easy to maintain.
